        Lyrics:
        I'm sitting here in the boring room
        It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
        I'm wasting my time
        I got nothing to do
        I'm hanging around
        I'm waiting for you
        But nothing ever happens and I wonder
        I'm driving around in my car
        I'm driving too fast
        I'm driving too far
        I'd like to change my point of view
        I feel so lonely
        I'm waiting for you
        But nothing ever happens and I wonder
        I wonder how
        I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
        I'm turning my head up and down
        I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
        And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
        I'm sitting here
        I miss the power
        I'd like to go out taking a shower
        But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
        I feel so tired
        Put myself into bed
        While nothing ever happens and I wonder
        Isolation is not good for me
        Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree
        I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
        Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
        And everything will happen and you wonder
        I wonder how
        I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
        And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
        I'm turning my head up and down
        I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
        And I wonder, wonder
        I wonder how
        I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
        And all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can see
        Is just a yellow lemon-tree
